# MAINTENANCE, INSPECTION, AND TESTING OF ELECTRIC AND HYDRAULIC ELEVATORS

# 1. INTRODUCTION

# 1.1 Purpose

There are over 125 elevators at various Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) pumping plants, powerplants, dams, office buildings, tunnels, and visitor facilities. The safety of these elevators is an ongoing concern of Reclamation. While elevators are generally considered to be an extremely reliable and safe means of vertical transportation, it is only by a thorough program of inspection and testing that they can be considered to be so. A malfunctioning elevator system potentially may cause loss of life or serious injury. Many of the elevator systems at Bureau facilities are aging and may not have had a reliable record of inspection and maintenance. Many of these elevators may lack some of the safety features that are required by code to build an elevator today.

The primary purpose of this document is to assert that conformance to the elevator safety codes developed by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) is required. The Bureau of Reclamation Safety and Health Standards (BRSHS) require that permanent elevators be inspected and maintained in accordance with the current editions of ASME A17.1 - “Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators” (the Code) and ASME A17.2 - “Inspectors' Manual for Elevators and Escalators.” In addition, BRSHS requires testing and certifying elevators in accordance with the Code. Much of the information contained in this document was obtained from the ASME codes and related publications.

# 1.2 Pertinent ASME Elevator Codes

The ASME Elevator Codes and publications that are pertinent to the inspection and maintenance of Reclamation elevators are as follows:

- ASME A17.1 – “Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators” – covers installation requirements for new elevators, as well as maintenance and test requirements for existing equipment.
- ASME A17.2 - “Inspectors' Manual for Elevators and Escalators” – is a guide that provides recommended procedures for inspection and testing of equipment to comply with A17.1 and A17.3. (A17.2.1 pertains to Electric Elevators; A17.2.2 pertains to Hydraulic Elevators)
- ASME A17.3 – “Safety Code for Existing Elevators and Escalators” – covers retroactive requirements for existing elevators and escalators. Establishes minimum standards for all elevator equipment regardless of the installation date. This code takes into account the existing building structural conditions that would limit the feasibility of bringing the elevator up to current ASME A17.1 requirements.

# FIST 2-10

# MAINTENANCE, INSPECTION, AND TESTING OF ELECTRIC AND HYDRAULIC ELEVATORS

ASME A17.4 – “Guide for Emergency Evacuation of Passengers from Elevators” – establishes procedures for the safe evacuation of passengers from stalled elevators.

ASME A17.1 Handbook and ASME A17.1 Interpretations – provide assistance for understanding and gaining insight into the Code requirements and rules.

ASME QEI-1 - establishes the requirements for the qualification, duties, and responsibilities of inspectors and inspection supervisors engaged in inspection and testing.

The Code requires that maintenance, repair, and replacements only need to conform to the Code at the time of the original installation. However, alteration of the elevator is required to conform to the Code at the time of the alteration. New additions to the Code are issued approximately every 3 years, along with intermediate supplements, which are issued as needed.

Alteration is defined in the Code as: "any change to equipment, including its parts, components, and/or subsystems, other than maintenance, repair, or replacement."

Maintenance is defined in the Code as: "a process of routine examination, lubrication, cleaning, and adjustment of parts, components, and/or subsystems for the purpose of ensuring performance in accordance with the applicable Code requirements."

Repair is defined in the Code as: "reconditioning or renewal of parts, components, and/or subsystems necessary to keep equipment in accordance with applicable Code requirements."

Replacement is defined in the Code as: "The substitution of a device or component and/or subsystems, in its entirety, with a unit that is basically the same as the original for the purpose of ensuring performance in accordance with applicable Code requirements."

# 2. GENERAL MAINTENANCE

A strong preventive maintenance program, combined with scheduled testing, will help to ensure future safety, performance, and economy of Reclamation elevators.

When determining the maintenance intervals, take into account the manufacturer's recommendations, how often the elevator is used, the severity of equipment loading, the age and wear of the equipment, the equipment’s operating environment, and the inherent quality of the equipment.

# FIST 2-10

# MAINTENANCE, INSPECTION, AND TESTING OF ELECTRIC AND HYDRAULIC ELEVATORS

All maintenance, repairs, replacements, and alterations must conform to the applicable section of the Code. At no time, except when necessary during tests and inspections, may required safety devices or electrical protection devices be made ineffective. In the event that these devices are made temporarily ineffective, they must be returned to full operating condition before the elevator can be returned to service.

# 2.1 Scope of Preventive Maintenance

The scope of the preventive maintenance program shall be comprehensive and shall include, at a minimum:

- Inspection
- Adjustments
- Lubrication
- Repairs and replacements (including light bulbs/lamps)
- Housekeeping/cleaning
- Recordkeeping

The program shall maintain the elevator to run at rated speed, rated capacity, desired door open/close timing, designated floor stops, required floor leveling parameters, etc.

# 2.2 Maintenance Personnel

In accordance with the Code, maintenance, repairs, or replacements are to be performed only by persons trained to perform these operations on the equipment.

# 2.3 Recordkeeping

A complete log must be kept that contains records of all maintenance, adjustments, repairs, replacement, etc., performed on the elevator. The log must include the dates, names of participating personnel, and description of tasks performed, including tests and inspections, reports, trouble calls, corrective action, recommendations, or any other incidents related to the elevator.

Manufacturer's data and drawings for the elevator equipment shall be accessible and maintained to reflect the current state of the equipment. Important data such as manufacturer names, part numbers, serial numbers, sizes, and types shall be readily accessible. Any pertinent service bulletins shall also be kept.

Checklists for the scheduled preventive maintenance tasks shall be developed and kept to ensure that these tasks are performed.

# FIST 2-10

# MAINTENANCE, INSPECTION, AND TESTING OF ELECTRIC AND HYDRAULIC ELEVATORS

# 2.4 Safety

The following practices shall be observed, at a minimum, during maintenance, inspection, or testing procedures:

- All safety devices must be in operational condition.
- Lockout/tagout procedures must be followed if maintenance procedures require that the equipment not be operated.
- Ensure that personnel performing maintenance, inspection, and testing tasks wear clothing that is not loose fitting and that they are provided with proper protective equipment, such as safety shoes, hard hats, eye protection, and hand protection.
- Provide barriers and signage, where applicable, especially at hoistway doors.
- Upon completion of work, remove any jumper wires that were used.
- It is possible that the elevator pit may be designated a "Permit Required Confined Space." The additional required safe procedures must be attended to in these cases.
- Provide proper lighting.
- Determine that adequate refuge space exists above and below the car.
- Ensure the working area is clean and dry.

(More detailed safety procedures can be found in publications such as the Elevator Industry Field Employees' Safety Handbook.)

# 3. INSPECTIONS

# 3.1 General

ASME A17.1 recommends that periodic inspections be performed at 6-month intervals by a Qualified Elevator Inspector, as defined by ASME QEI-1. The inspections are performed to determine whether the existing equipment conforms to the Code.

In some cases, such as with elevators that are rarely or never used, where the ambient conditions are good (not tending or likely to degrade and damage equipment), the recommended inspection intervals could be extended up to 12 months, as long as

# FIST 2-10

# MAINTENANCE, INSPECTION, AND TESTING OF ELECTRIC AND HYDRAULIC ELEVATORS

agreement is reached and documented among facility managers, safety engineers, and other responsible personnel. Conversely, the recommended inspection interval could be shortened for some or all of the equipment, if deemed necessary.

# FIST 2-10

# MAINTENANCE, INSPECTION, AND TESTING OF ELECTRIC AND HYDRAULIC ELEVATORS

# 5. ADDITIONAL ITEMS

# 5.1 Pre-1970 Hydraulic Elevators

The Code did not require hydraulic elevators to possess a safety bulkhead until 1970. Hydraulic elevators installed before 1970 shall be scrutinized and frequently checked for leakage. It is recommended that these elevators have their cylinders replaced or, at minimum, that the elevator jack be provided with an external safety device to arrest the jack from uncontrolled descent.

In addition, poor insulation or lack of cathodic protection of the hydraulic cylinder may significantly shorten the life of the elevator system and render it unsafe, even if the cylinder was installed with a safety bulkhead. The use of noncorroding plastic liners is a recent design development. Most older hydraulic elevators were installed with steel liners, which are more susceptible to corrosion attack.

# 5.2 Americans with Disabilities Act - Accessibility Guidelines (28 CFR Part 36 Appendix A) (ADAAG)

The requirements of ADAAG include provisions that promote the safety and accessibility of disabled persons who use elevators. Reclamation elevators that are used by the general public or disabled facility personnel shall be considered for upgrade to meet ADAAG.

# 5.3 Prohibition of Governor Rope Lubrication

To avoid over-lubrication of the governor rope, which could lead to failure of the governor to activate the safety and arrest an overspeeding car, the Code prohibits the lubrication of the governor ropes after installation.

# 5.4 Rope Retirement Criteria

The Code and the Inspector’s Manual provide specific criteria for when the replacement of the governor, suspension, and compensation ropes are required. The ropes must be clean enough to effectively inspect them for breaks, abrasion, corrosion, wear, reduced diameter, etc.

# 5.5 Code Data Plate

ASME A17.1 requires that a data plate, indicating the Code edition in effect at the time of installation and the Code edition at the time of any alteration, be located in plain view and attached to either the main line disconnect or the controller. The Code edition(s) indicated on the data plate govern the testing and inspection requirements.

# 5.6 Acceptance Inspections and Tests of New or Altered Installations

ASME A17.1 requires that new or altered installations of both electric and hydraulic elevators be subjected to acceptance inspections and tests before being placed in service. The series of inspections and tests for new installations is comprehensive (inside car, machine room, top of car, outside hoistway, pit, and firefighters' emergency operation) and is detailed in the Code. The series of inspections and tests for altered installations generally involves those items that were affected and depends on the nature and effects of the alterations. These inspections and tests are also detailed in the Code.

# 5.7 Escalators, Moving Walks, Dumbwaiters, and Special Application Elevators

ASME A17.1 provides the requirements for testing and inspecting escalators and moving walks.

The requirements for dumbwaiters, material lifts, and special application elevators such as inclined, limited-use/limited-application, rooftop, special purpose personnel, and construction are generally the same as standard elevators and are detailed in ASME A17.1, which lists pertinent exceptions and additions.

# 5.8 Personnel Hoists Not Covered by ASME A17.1

ASME A17.1 does not specifically cover the equipment associated with personnel hoists that are within the scope of the following codes (among others): ANSI 10.4, ASME A90.1, ANSI A92, or ASME 120.1. The personnel hoists covered under these codes are generally temporary or mobile personnel hoisting systems that are not a permanent part of buildings and are used mainly during construction, demolition, or maintenance operations.
