# INTRODUCTION

Singapore is a densely populated country with many high-rise buildings. There are currently about 70,0001 lifts in Singapore, and this number will continue to increase as vertical transportation equipment, such as lifts, have become essential to modern living.

The Building and Construction Authority (BCA), in close collaboration with industry stakeholders, regularly reviews the regulatory regime to ensure that it remains relevant and effective. Lift safety is a shared responsibility, and as an owner, you play an important role in ensuring that your lifts are well-maintained and comply with the regulations.

This guide identifies good practices in procuring, operating and maintaining lifts, so that you can make informed decisions and take necessary actions towards ensuring the safety of your lifts.

# I AM GETTING A NEW LIFT, WHAT SHOULD I CONSIDER?

# What Good Practices Should I Adopt When I Procure a New Lift?

Adopting good practices will…

- Reduce downstream lift breakdowns
- Allow for better planning and forecasting of maintenance schedules

# PRE-QUALIFICATION

This is a two-step process generally carried out for larger projects. It will give you assurance that the contractors tendering for the job have the necessary experience and financial capability to carry out the job and deliver quality products that comply with the specifications, on time and on budget.

You should:

1. Invite potential contractors (tenderers) to submit information and documentation supporting the following:
- Qualifications — Competency of technicians, supervisors and engineers
- Experience — Track records and years of service of technicians, supervisors and engineers
- Financial Status
2. Check documents and assign a score to each prospective tenderer based on their submissions. Those who score above a pre-determined point will be shortlisted to tender for the project.

# TENDER EVALUATION

When choosing a contractor for the installation of your new lift, in addition to considering the cost criteria, you should also evaluate the tender based upon a weighted set of criteria such as Performance, Reliability and Track Records; and allocate the score weightage based on how critical each criterion is to your needs.

The contractor should be able to fulfill the following evaluation requirements:

# Performance

- Demonstrate necessary technical knowledge on installation, operation and maintenance of equipment
- Have the necessary technical capability, or technical support from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), to troubleshoot more complex problems

# Reliability

- Provide records such as monthly fault rate and breakdown rate of the contractor’s past contracts
- Review and consider reliability of the equipment’s main components

# Track Records

- Provide track records on having installed lifts of similar make, ISO and safety certifications, and insurance, among others.

Good Practices Guide for Lift Owners | 6

# OBTAINING A PERMIT-TO-OPERATE (PTO)

# Building and Construction Authority

# PERMIT TO OPERATE

Once your new lift has been fully installed on site, you should have the following items, endorsed by the Professional Engineer (PE) (Mechanical or Electrical Engineering) supervising the installation works:

- A copy of the lift location plan
- Certificate of Supervision of Installation of Lift(s) (CSC04)

You should also carry out the following steps to obtain a PTO for your new lift:

- Engage a registered lift service contractor to carry out periodic maintenance and examination, inspection and testing of the lift, and a Specialist Professional Engineer (SPE) in the field of lift and escalator engineering to certify the lift.
- Log in to OPTO system to apply for a PTO. The application requires payment of a fee and inputs from the registered lift service contractor and SPE.
- Print out a copy of the PTO for each lift, and display it in a prominent position within the lift for operation.

You can find the step-by-step process flow chart in Appendix D.

# CHOOSING A SUITABLE MAINTENANCE CONTRACT

# What Are the Different Types of Maintenance Contracts?

Maintenance services are generally classified into:

- Comprehensive maintenance contracts
- Standard maintenance contracts

# COMPREHENSIVE VS STANDARD

# MAINTENANCE CONTRACT

# MAINTENANCE CONTRACT

Let’s compare the two!

|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|
|• For a fixed fee, this contract covers servicing, maintenance, repairs and replacements when required, within the lift’s life expectancy or within the duration of the contract — excluding vandalism or parts that lift users have access to, such as buttons and lift interior. • Lift service contractors offer different packages with different scopes of coverage, depending on your needs and budget.|• Replacement of worn out and defective parts will have additional cost to be borne by you.|

|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|
|• Provides standard checks and replacements of consumables, such as lubrication oil. • Much cheaper than a comprehensive maintenance contract.|• If there are no clear criteria, replacement of parts might be delayed due to cost cutting.|

Good Practices Guide for Lift Owners | 8

# MAINTENANCE CONTRACT EVALUATION

Upon deciding on the type of maintenance contract, you should evaluate the maintenance contract. Similar to the tender evaluation for new installations of lifts, the evaluation for maintenance contracts is based on Performance, Reliability and Track Records.

# The contractor should be able to fulfill the following evaluation requirements:

# Performance

- Demonstrate necessary technical knowledge on operation and maintenance of equipment
- Have the necessary technical capability, or technical support from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), to troubleshoot more complex problems
- Advise on time required for performing periodic maintenance and be capable of dealing with emergencies like mantrap and lift breakdowns*

# Reliability

- Submit breakdown and maintenance records of similar lift models to demonstrate competency and capability in lift maintenance

# MAINTENANCE CONTROL PLAN

In the traditional model where repairs are only carried out when the lifts have broken down, the unavailability of replacement parts typically results in lengthy lift down time, while waiting for parts to be shipped from overseas. Furthermore, the breakdown of parts could also result in unsafe situations. To address the issue, it is strongly recommended for you and your lift service contractors to develop and agree to a Maintenance Control Plan (MCP).

A MCP is a schedule that clearly prescribes any major maintenance required, and replacement criteria for each component throughout the lifecycle of the lift. The replacement criteria for some components, such as the electronic parts, could be time-based while those for other components could be condition-based. The MCP will provide more certainty to you and your lift service contractor when a lift component requires replacement. This could facilitate you to plan and budget for the cost of the replacement, and the contractor could ensure that the components are ready for the replacement. The MCP will be the document to refer to in the case of a dispute between you and your lift service contractor on part replacement.

# Track Records

- Provide track records of having serviced lifts of similar make
- Provide company details, such as number of maintenance technicians per lift, current projects on hand, ISO and safety certifications, and insurance, among others

* You may also take other performance matrices into account, such as response time to incidents and breakdowns, and time taken to resolve them.

Good Practices Guide for Lift Owners | 9

# OPERATING YOUR LIFT SAFELY

# What Do I Need to Know About Lift Safety?

Ensure that…

- Systems and measures are put in place to enhance safe use of lifts and prevent user-related incidents
- Feedback on lift malfunctions is taken seriously, so that lift service contractors can investigate and rectify issues promptly

# GOOD PRACTICES FOR LIFT SAFETY YOU CAN ALSO FOLLOW

Conduct daily basic checks to ensure lifts function properly. Appendix B provides you with a checklist of items that you could use to check your own lifts.

# Equipment

# Signage

Display BCA’s “Safe Use of Lifts” poster within or outside the lifts (See Appendix E) to remind users of desired and undesired behaviours when using lifts.

# Audible Warnings

Provide lift car audible warnings (such as buzzer) to remind passengers to keep their fingers away when the lift car doors are opening and closing.

Good Practices Guide for Lift Owners | 10

# CCTV

Install sufficient number of CCTVs to meet the following minimum specifications:

- a. Capacity to record 24 hours a day, 7 days a week;
- b. Capture the lift car, lift car door(s) and in-car floor indicator;
- c. Frame rate of at least 6 frames per second;
- d. Video resolution of at least 352 x 240 pixels or CIF CCTV resolution; and
- e. Storage of video footage of at least 30 days.

Video recording is mandatory for lifts installed in projects where the first set of plans (either building plans or structural plans, whichever is earlier) is submitted to the Commissioner of Building Control for approval on or after 1 December 2017.

# Performance Gauge

Track and monitor equipment breakdown rates to gauge lift performance. If you notice degradation in the equipment performance, you may wish to investigate to identify root causes and review the current maintenance programme.

Good Practices Guide for Lift Owners | 11

# WHAT TO DO IF A LIFT BREAKS DOWN

If the lift stalls and someone is trapped in the lift, you should:

1. Inform the lift service contractor
2. Advise the trapped person to stay calm and wait for help

Do not pry open the lift doors or otherwise attempt to free the occupants from the trapped lift by yourself.

# WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN A LIFT INCIDENT OCCURS

As a lift owner, you should take all public feedback seriously and ensure the lift service contractors rectify any issues promptly.

When an incident involves death or injury, or if failure of safety critical components occurs2, you should do the following:

1. Inform your lift service contractor to carry out rescue works, or contact the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) in the event that your lift service contractor is unable to perform the rescue.
2. Immediately shut down and cordon off the incident lift to preserve the incident site.
3. Call BCA’s incident numbers (9088 7289 or 9782 7296) as soon as practicable to inform of the incident. Please note that these incident numbers should be strictly used for incident reporting only.
4. Follow up with a completed incident report and attach the report through the BCA Feedback/Enquiry page within 24 hours of the incident.

You may wish to refer to Appendix C for more information on incident reporting.

|---|---|
|Less efficiently run systems|Increased lift availability during operational hours|
|Higher chances of breakdowns|Reduced interruption to business|
|Longer downtimes to rectify problems and bring systems back online|Good standing of lift owner within the community|

# WHAT ARE MY RESPONSIBILITIES AS A LIFT OWNER DURING MAINTENANCE?

As a lift owner, you have the responsibility of ensuring proper maintenance of your lifts by a registered lift service contractor. You should:

- Ensure lifts are kept in a proper state of repair, in safe working order and meet the Maintenance Requirements stipulated in the BMSM Regulations 2016 (See Appendix A).
- Keep proper maintenance records in connection with the lift for a period of at least 5 years, which include all instances of breakdowns and incidents, with as much detail about the factors, causes and operating state of the equipment and passengers (if any) written within.
- Ensure adequate placement of barriers, barricades and warning signs when lifts are not operational, and before and during maintenance works.
- Provide space on site for barricade storage.*

* Take note that contractors should also ensure an adequate number of maintenance personnel on site, with proper Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and tools issued to each personnel.

Good Practices Guide for Lift Owners | 13

# WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN TAKING OVER AN EXISTING LIFT?

When taking over an existing installation, you should:

- Engage a registered lift service contractor, in conjunction with a SPE, to survey and ascertain that equipment are in compliance with the code and standards intended, as well as other shortcomings which may affect safe usage of the equipment, such as wear and tear.
- Consider modernising the lift based on BCA’s recommendations (Refer to Pg 18) to meet the latest requirements. You will need to engage a registered lift service contractor if you wish to carry out such modernisation works.
- Obtain all relevant drawings, documentation and passwords from the previous owner or contractor.
- Access the OPTO system and apply for a transfer of ownership for all lifts that were taken over.

# HOW FREQUENTLY SHOULD I MAINTAIN MY LIFTS?

You are required to engage registered lift service contractors to maintain your lifts, in accordance with the maintenance requirements set out in the BMSM Regulations 2016. The lift service contractor must carry out the maintenance works at a frequency not less than the following:

|Type of equipment|Frequency of periodic maintenance|
|---|---|
|Home lift, vertical platform lift or stairlift|Based on manufacturer’s recommended frequency (where available); OR Once every 3 months (whichever is more frequent)|
|Any other lift|Based on manufacturer’s recommended frequency (where available); OR Once every month (whichever is more frequent)|

Good Practices Guide for Lift Owners | 14

# WHAT DOES MAJOR ALTERATION OR REPLACEMENT (A/R) WORK FOR LIFTS CONSIST OF AND WHAT SHOULD I DO?

Before any major A/R is carried out, you must access the Online Permit to Operate (OPTO) system and notify the Commissioner of Buildings of the major A/R works required.

As per Regulation 17(2) of the BMSM Regulations 2016, major A/R on a lift includes, but is not limited to, any of the following:

- A Changing, adding or removing any safety device of a lift
- B Changing the mass of a lift car (including lift car finishing)
- C Changing the rated load or speed of a lift
- D Changing the travel distance of a lift
- E Changing the lift control operation (including changing the software or type of driving machine or brakes)
- F Changing the number, type or size of the hoisting ropes supporting a lift car or its counterweight
- G Changing the size of the guide rails of a lift
- H Changing the type of safety gear
- I Changing the lift landing and car door(s), lift car door drive and control

One-to-one replacements of parts with the same design and specification (e.g. arising from wear and tear) are not considered as major A/R work.

# SAFE, SMART AND EFFICIENT LIFTS

Did you know that technological enhancements to lifts can bring about significant benefits, such as time and cost savings? Read on to find out more about these recent advances in lift technologies.

# INTRODUCING ENERGY EFFICIENT LIFTS WITH REGENERATIVE DRIVE

A regenerative drive is a device which…

- Transmits power, which is distributed by a traction elevator
- Allows transmitted power to be reused by the building’s power supply for other systems
- Saves up to 30% energy, compared to lifts without the device

# HOW DO REGENERATIVE DRIVES WORK?

- Traction drive machines with regenerative drive function as power generators
- Energy is generated when:
- a) Lift travels down with a heavy car load
- b) Lift travels up with a light car load
- Energy is transmitted to a power distributor by a regenerative converter

|Power distribution converter|Heavily loaded car|Heavily loaded car|
|---|---|---|
| |Lightly loaded car|Lightly loaded car|

Good Practices Guide for Lift Owners | 16

# INTRODUCING REMOTE MONITORING AND DIAGNOSTICS (RM&D)

The possibility of remote monitoring and diagnostics for lifts is quickly becoming a reality, and may be widely adopted in the near future. Speak to your lift maintenance contractors to evaluate how your existing lifts may tap on this new technology.

# Remote Monitoring & Control

# Lift Operation Data

# Data Analytics

# Pre-empt Breakdowns

# Pre-empt Parts Failure

# Benefits

Remote monitoring and diagnostics allows you to…

# Predictive Maintenance

- Analyse and anticipate when lift components might fail and replace them before they do, with the help of a lift contractor

# Real-Time Information

- Know your lift status and performance at all times

# Better Reliability and Uptime

- Ensure unforeseen breakdowns happen less frequently, which decreases the number of mantrap cases
- Technicians will also be able to quickly identify problems during breakdowns and bring the lift back into operation within a shorter time

Good Practices Guide for Lift Owners | 17

# Information Monitored

Remote monitoring typically monitors information such as:

- Lift movement
- Position
- Car and landing calls
- Lift status
- Door motion
- Lift faults

More sophisticated systems allow you to obtain information such as the total hours of maintenance per unit, total cumulative breakdowns, total cumulative repair hours and failure rates, which can enable identification and possible correlations of problems.

# MODERNISE YOUR LIFTS

Modernisation is the process of upgrading certain parts of a lift so that it is able to utilise newer technology, increasing efficiency and user safety. In certain cases, you may also wish to consider a complete overhaul of your lift.

# Why Modernise?

If your lift is old, it could result in…

# WHAT NEEDS TO BE MODERNISED?

Replace or upgrade safety critical components such as…

- Controller equipment
- Hoist machines
- Electrical wiring
- Governor systems
- Additional safety features (up to par with current Codes and Standards)

New lift components and parts which require less maintenance needs are also highly encouraged, to reduce maintenance burden. Please refer to Appendix G for the list of Lift Parts with Less Maintenance Needs.

Due to constraints such as site condition and equipment incompatibility, you should engage a consultant or a registered lift service contractor to conduct a feasibility study of the existing installation and conditions before modernising your lift. You should also consider factors such as space availability, technical feasibility and cost implications.

# Deterioration of Performance

# Difficulty in obtaining parts or obsolete parts

# Longer lead time for replacement parts

# Costlier maintenance

Good Practices Guide for Lift Owners | 18

# WHICH OF MY LIFTS SHOULD I MODERNISE?

Older lifts (more than 15 years) are highly recommended to be considered for modernisation. You should include the following eight (8) items, which are not found in older lifts, based on the advisory issued by BCA on 3 October 2016 (Refer to Appendix F).

1. Ascending Car Overspeed Protection (ACOP)
Stops the lift car in the event of uncontrolled upwards overspeeding
2. Unintended Car Movement Protection (UCMP)
Arrests unintended movement of the lift car away from the landing zone, which prevents passengers from getting hurt while entering or exiting the lift car
3. Slacken Governor Rope Electrical Safety Device
Monitors the status of the governor rope — if the rope slackens beyond its allowable limits, it will initiate a stop of the lift car movement
4. Light Curtains as a Door Protective Device, with Its Nudging Mode De-Activated
Allows lift doors to reopen when an obstruction is detected in between, without touching the obstruction
5. Electrical Safety Interlocking for Multi-Panel Door
Ensures that multi-paneled lift cars can move only if all panels have been fully closed
6. Car Apron
Prevents passengers from falling into the lift pit during emergency evacuation, when the car has stopped above the lift landing
7. Telephone, Intercom System or Other Communication Device
Enables notification or direct communication with personnel who can activate an emergency response, allowing them to ascertain condition of passengers and provide reassurance
8. Automatic Rescue Device (ARD)
Enables the lift to automatically move to the nearest floor and allow trapped passengers to exit the lift, in the event of power failure

Actual improvements/advantages after switching to the alternatives will vary from different suppliers. Lift owners are encouraged to discuss with their lift suppliers and/or lift service contractors on the actual benefits, performance, reliability, cost, timeline, etc.

For the Good Practices Guide For Lift Owners, BCA would like to thank HDB, JTC, LTA, Lift and Escalator Sectoral Tripartite Committee (STC) - Working Committee (Working Conditions & Technology Adoption), Singapore Lift & Escalator Contractors & Manufacturers Association (SLECMA), Association of Strata Managers (ASM) and Association of Property & Facility Managers (APFM) for their contributions.
